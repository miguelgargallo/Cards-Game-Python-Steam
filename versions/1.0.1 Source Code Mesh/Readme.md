Here is a high-level audit of the file:

    The turns module is imported at the top of the file, but it is not used anywhere in the script.
    The cards list is created and then shuffled, but it is not used anywhere in the game.
    The player_deck and computer_deck lists are created and then dealt cards from the cards list, but the cards list is not used again.
    The card_effects dictionary is defined but not used in the game.
    The game is played in a loop that continues until either the player or the computer has no more cards. However, the loop is not actually necessary as the game can be implemented using a series of functions that are called in sequence.
    The get_player_move() and draw_card() functions are defined but not used in the game.
    The game is played by comparing the player's and computer's current cards and deciding the winner based on the card effects. However, the card effects are not used anywhere in the game, so the player and the computer could just as well be comparing random cards.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Here is a list of 25 potential improvements for the two files:

    Remove the unused code from both files. This includes the turn() and card() functions in turns.py, as well as the cards list, the get_player_move() and draw_card() functions, and the card_effects dictionary in games.py.
    Refactor the cards_in_turn_1() to cards_in_turn_5() functions in turns.py into a single function that takes the number of turns to display as a parameter and uses a loop to print the current and previous cards.
    Modify the game loop in games.py to use a series of functions instead of a loop. This will make the game easier to understand and modify.
    Implement the card effects in the game by comparing the card effects in the card_effects dictionary rather than just comparing the cards themselves.
    Modify the game to draw new cards for the player and the computer if either of them does not have any cards left.
    Add a function to check for the end of the game and determine the winner.
    Implement a scoring system for the game.
    Add a function to allow the player to choose their card from their deck instead of always playing the first card.
    Add a function to let the player choose to play a card from their hand or draw a new card.
    Implement a "wildcard" card that can be played as any other card.
    Add a function to shuffle the player's and computer's decks when they run out of cards.
    Add a function to display the current scores for the player and the computer.
    Add a function to display the player's and computer's remaining cards.
    Add a function to allow the player to view the rules of the game.
    Implement a two-player mode for the game.
    Add a function to let the player choose the number of cards in their deck.
    Add a function to let the player choose the number of turns in the game.
    Add a function to allow the player to customize the card effects.
    Implement a "skip turn" card that allows the player to skip their turn.
    Implement a "draw two" card that forces the other player to draw two cards.
    Add a function to let the player choose the number of card decks to use in the game.
    Add a function to let the player choose the cards to include in the game.
    Implement a "reverse" card that reverses the order of play.
    Implement a "swap hands" card that allows the player to swap their hand with the computer's hand.
    Add a function to save the player's progress and allow them to resume the game later.
