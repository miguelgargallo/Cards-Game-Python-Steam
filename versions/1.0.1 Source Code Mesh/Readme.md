# Updates

## v1.0.2 Audit Update

    Add comments to explain the purpose of each block of code. This will make it easier to understand the code and improve its readability.

    Consider using a dictionary to map the cards to their corresponding effects, rather than using a series of if statements. This will make the code more concise and easier to maintain.

    Use a function to reset the game at the end of each round. This will reduce redundancy and make the code easier to read.

    Use descriptive variable names to make the code more readable. For example, you could use player_card and computer_card instead of player_deck[turn-1] and computer_deck[turn-1].

    Use a for loop to iterate over the turns, rather than a while loop with a counter variable. This will make the code simpler and easier to understand.

    Consider using a for loop to deal the cards to each player, rather than using a for loop with a counter variable. This will make the code more concise and easier to understand.

    Consider adding error handling to handle invalid input and prevent the program from crashing. For example, you could use a try-except block to handle the case where the user enters a value that cannot be converted to an integer.

## 1.0.3 Table on the match

We added a table to view the cards.

```bash
Player's cards: ðŸŒ± ðŸª¨ ðŸ’§ ðŸ’¨ ðŸ”¥ ðŸŒ± ðŸª¨ ðŸ’§ ðŸ’¨ ðŸ”¥ ðŸŒ±
Computer's cards: ðŸ’¨ ðŸ”¥ ðŸŒ± ðŸª¨ ðŸ’§ ðŸ’¨ ðŸ”¥ ðŸŒ± ðŸª¨ ðŸ’§ ðŸ’¨
```
